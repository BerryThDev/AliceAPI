# Known issues

- I'm getting an IllegalArgumentException: Alice API is not available
- This may happen due to Alice's loader, Try to delay the initialization process to make sure Alice has been fully loaded. (You can achieve this by making a variable and initializing it a few seconds later, Or by using Alice's AliceEnableEvent)
